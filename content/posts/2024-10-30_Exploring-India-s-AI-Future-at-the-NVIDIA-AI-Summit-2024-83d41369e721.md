With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles, the role of AI becomes crucial. **NVIDIA’s Program Architect** for Autonomous Driving Solutions detailed the three core components for self-driving tech — AI **training**, **simulation**, and the **autonomous driving** itself. Each requires its own accelerated computing platform. The session delved into the intricate requirements for training robust models in diverse road conditions, simulating complex driving scenarios, and ensuring the car’s system can make real-time decisions with high accuracy.

#### 3. Adapting Multilingual Language Models for Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study for Hindi Nemotron

This session focused on a challenge close to home: supporting low-resource languages. NVIDIA’s Senior Data Scientist explored the complexities of adapting large language models (LLMs) to function effectively for languages like Hindi, which lack sufficient linguistic resources. Techniques like Nemotron, a case study for Hindi language processing, showcased how AI can be tailored to better serve the linguistic diversity of countries like India, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility in AI solutions.

#### 4. Robotics and Physical AI in the Era of Generative AI
